Container = Spring container - where objects are stored for Dependency injection

###class annotatinos

@Componenet - creates a bean object in Spring container (a sigleton is made when without @Scope i.e. use same obj all the time)
@Componenet("name") - to change the name of the bean obj made in container. default name is class name
@Scope("prototype")  - creates an obj everytime asked contex.getBean(className)

>>spring MVC>>
@Controler  - In spring MVC take this class as a Spring Contriler. 

###method annotations

```@RequestMapping``` - map a request to a method in a Controller. 
```@ResponseBody``` - when this is NOT used, spring MVC will think (since return type of method is String) that you are returning a View name.
                so it will search for the View (jsp file). This annotation is used when you want to return a data and SpringMVC 
		DispatcherServlet will simply pass that data to the client(browser) in the response.
		```return repo.findAll().toString();```
@PathVariable - When wildcards are used as ```@RequestMapping("/alian/{aid}")```

###variable annotations

```@Autowired``` - spring searchs for an object of the variable type in container.
```@Qualifire("name to search in the container")```  - every bean object in spring container has a name
```@RequestParam``` - to get URL parameters assigned to method arguments.


ModleAndView class send data(model) from Controler to View. get that data from View(jsp file) with ${varName} i.e. JSTL format
in the controler request dispatch method >> mv.addObject(key,value) ; mv.setViewName(nameOfJSPFile)



###JPA accotations

```@Entity```    - For Spring Modelclasses when need to be persisted by JPA
```@Id``` - primary key
```@Query("the query in JPQL")``` - above a method name in the repo interface do run a custom querry. 

in JPA you need a Repository interface as a DAO to deal with a database

```public interface MyRepo extends CrudRepository<MyPOJO, Integer(i.e. primaryKey)>```
