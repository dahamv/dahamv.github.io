  ## Angular project files overview
  
  - *tslint.json* - To define coding rules for the linter (code analysis tool) to drive consistency across teams (eg. use === instead of ==)
  - *tsconfig.json* - Typescript compilation settings.
  - *protractor.json* - for end-end testing and goes hand-in-hand with e2e folder. (Used by QA team)
  - *package.json* - dev dependencies and runtime dependencies.
  - *package-lock.json* - created whith ```npm install``` and will have all the scripts and tools needed. It locks down the exact versions that got installed so that when another person gets the source code he will also get the same versions of the dependencies. Don't usually mess with this file.
  - *karma.conf.json* - for unit testing. *Karma* is a test runner.
  - .editerconfig - config for code editers. Some editers understand this and some don't. ( eg: Do I want spaces vs tabs when I press Tab)
  - *angular-cli.json* - Has things like - source code root folder/ where the build files should go to / whats the home page(index.html) / whats the first script that starts up (main.ts)
